title: Who Am I?
---

I'm a multi-disciplined engineer interested in practical applications of "tools of the trade". Cheap computers and readily available sensors and communications interfaces make so many things possible that I find it impossible to resist building neat stuff from the bottom up.

I started my career with a BS in Ship Design, then got a MS in Electrical Engineering, and have spent time doing all kinds of communications and microelectronics stuff. I always get a kick out of figuring out how stuff breaks and how to fix it.

I've gotten a lot of help on line and this blogsite is an attempt to give a bit back.
